This is a basic instruction on how to use github
I barely know it myself but I can give useful tips.
If you can learn how to use github please share to the group. :)

*We will discuss what will be pushed to the MAIN BRANCH once we decide if the code is good!*

*Both Netbeans or Eclipse IDE will be acceptable for this project since we are going to be using java.

So to start off make your on branch. This branch will be a way to assess what people can do and allow for you to make changes to your own 
code without messing with the final product. If you don't know I will be able to help you.

Next, would be to push the code via your IDE files. It's not hard at all, just copy paste and not forgetting to use " // " to comment.

*We are all able to compare code with each other by uing the "Create Pull Request" and then choosing the base and the compare.*

To upload file, just click on "upload files" and then drag the file and upload it to your branch.

*PlEASE REMEMBER WHERE THE WORKSPACE YOU SAVE THE FILES. THAT IS THOSE FILES YOU WANT TO PUSH!*

If we meet, we are able to use github desktop to push and pull code in live time.
